#Homework 5

## Description
MPI program calculate the summation of two 128x128 matrices.
There are 8 nodes that will each calculate the summations of 16 rows.

The master node will then gather the results and put them in a file called john_shamoon_matrix_output.txt.

## To run the program:
1. Connect to the grid.
2. qsub -I
3. make
4. exit
5. qsub -q wsuq jobscript
6. wait for output to be places in jobscript.o*, jobscript.e*, and john_shamoon_matrix_output.txt files.

# To remove the jobscript.e*, jobscript.o*, and matrix output files, run "make clean"
